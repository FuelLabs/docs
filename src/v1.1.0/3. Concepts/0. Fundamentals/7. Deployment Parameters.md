Here we will describe the Fuel contract's constructor parameters.

| field name            | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **operator**          | `address`; The primary operator of the Fuel rollup. This account receives priority access on including roots in blocks production, however, anyone else may use roots with a delay specified by the `submissionDelay` parameter. |
| **finalizationDelay** | `uint256`; The time to finalization in Ethereum blocks.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **submissionDelay**   | `uint256`; The number of Ethereum blocks a non-operator must wait before using a root in a block.                                                                                                                                |
| **penaltyDelay**      | `uint256`; The delay which the operator will face if they commit Fraud, until the time they may come back online as the primary operator.                                                                                        |
| **bondSize**          | `uint256`; The bond size required for block production, in wei.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **name**              | `string`; The name string used for contract identification and EIP-712 hashing.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **version**           | `string`; The version of the contract used for identification and EIP-712 hashing.                                                                                                                                               |
| **chainId**           | `uint256`; The Ethereum network chain identifier used for identification, replay attack protection, and EIP-712 hashing.                                                                                                         |
| **genesis**           | `bytes32`; The registered genesis block hash. This property is simply for vanity and can be set to any value as the minimum referenced block is always > 0.                                                                      |

### Deploying in Operated Mode
If you would like to deploy a Fuel chain in operated mode, use non-zero values for `operator` and `submissionDelay`.

### Deploying in Un-operated Mode
If you would like to deploy Fuel in un-operated mode, where anyone may submit blocks at any time, use zero values for `operator` and `submissionDelay`.

### Finalization Delays
In any optimistic rollup, finalization delay is a critical security parameter. A longer value provides more robustness against miner censorship attacks, but will result in longer withdrawals.

We recommend 1 week at the minimum, or 2 weeks on the higher end, to protect against both chain congestion attacks and censorship attacks.
