Fees

Structure
---

The Fuel priority aggregator will charge a fee based upon two factors:
1. Transaction size in bytes
2. A base USD target price per byte

Operated ORU's will target a USD price range between less than 1 cent to 3 cents per transaction.

If the token has no well established market value you may pay the fee in any token that does, we prefer Dai / USDC or Ether for these purposes or work out a price using our [Enterprise Structuring](#enterprisestructuring)


Competitive Rates

We will always try to reduce fees to as close to base operating cost as possible.
