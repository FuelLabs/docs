Addresses
===

The address registry maintains a mapping of address (20 bytes) to address ID (unsigned integer up to and including 19 bytes). Each time a new address is registered, it is assigned the next address ID in sequence.

Note that registering an address is not necessary to send or receive funds on Fuel. It is a purely optional way of reducing transaction sizes (and thus costs).
