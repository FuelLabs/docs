Introduction
---

Fuel is a permissionless and trustless layer-2 protocol for Ethereum, targeted at low-cost high-throughput value-transfer transactions. Fuel is powered by a highly-optimized _optimistic rollup design_.

Fuel's Features
---

- Completely decentralized: non-custodial, censorship resistant, and permissionless
- The most scalable optimistic rollup in the world, with unique UTXO-based design
- Up to 10,000 TPS surge intake capacity
- Send and receive using any Ethereum address, no registration required
- ETH and all ERC-20 tokens are supported
- Non-custodial token swaps between any tokens
- Fees can be paid in any token, not just ETH
- HTLCs for cross-chain atomic swaps and additional usecases
- Withdrawals in under 10 minutes using atomic swaps

What Makes Fuel Different
---

- UTXO-based design optimized for maximum scalability
    - Parallelism: transactions can be validated in parallel on consumer-grade hardware
    - No state bottleneck: unique fraud proof scheme doesn't require state serialization
- No special key formats or on-chain account registration required
- No upfront collateral requirements (unlike channels)
- Permissionless and censorship-resistant (unlike Plasma/Validium)
- No burdensome proof generation with high latency (unlike ZK rollups and Validium)
- No exotic cryptography (unlike ZK rollups and Validium)
- No trusted setup (unlike SNARK-based ZK rollups and Validium)
- No worse-than-useless protocol-specific token (unlike...too many to count)
- Care and attention to user-level issues
    - Can deposit using simple transfers from any account (including exchange accounts) using Funnel contracts
    - Can use a smart contract wallet to authorize transactions on Fuel
