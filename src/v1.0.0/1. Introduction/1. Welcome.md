## Introduction

Fuel is a trustless layer-2 Ethereum protocol for low-cost transactions and exchange. Fuel is powered by an optimistic rollup design. It uses fraud proofs, which leverage standard merkle proofing, elliptic signatures and bonds to ensure users funds are as safe as as Ethereum itself.

You can think of Fuel as a simplistic compression layer for Ethereum transaction data, we intake your transactions and swaps, making them cheaper without degrading the security of the underlying assets.

We use no ASCIs, trusted-setups, specialized keys, Snarks, Starks, upfront collateral or proprietary protocol tokens. All transactions can be validated on consumer hardware.

## Fuel Features

- Non-custodial, censorship resistant and permissionless
- The most efficient rollup ever constructed (~500 on-chain TPS)
- 10,000 TPS zero-confirmation capacity
- Send and receive transfers to any Ethereum address
- Supports non-custodial token swaps and exchange between any token
- Fees can be paid in the tokens being transfered
- Hash time lock contracts are supported for cross-chain atomic swaps
- Withdrawals under 15 minutes using HTLC's
- Eth and ERC20 token transfers
- Instant transaction and swap confirmations
- Multi-signature support using threshold signatures
- Privacy (coming soon)
- Smart-contracts (coming soon)

## What makes Fuel different
- Highest rollup TPS capacity possible
- Parallelism: transactions can be validated in parallel on consumer grade hardware
- Stateless: designed for lambda based quadratically scalable validation with no serialized state roots
- No special key formats or account registration steps required (Snarks/Starks)
- No upfront collateral requirements (Channels)
- No data-availability and censorship concerns (Plasma/Validium)
- Can deposit using simple transfers from any account (including exchange accounts)
- No specialized ASICS (Snarks/Starks)
- No trusted setup (Snarks)
- No snarks/starks or novel cryptography (Snarks/Starks)
- No specialized token required for any aspect of the protocol
