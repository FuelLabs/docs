Use Cases
===

In this section we explore various use cases for the Fuel [v1](../Future%20Roadmap/Planned%20Features.md#fuelv1) optimistic rollup. All the use cases covered below are examined in more detail in the [Tools and Applications](../4.%20Tools%20and%20Applications/0.%20Fast%20Withdrawals.md) section.

Transfers
---

Fuel can be used for high-performance, low-latency global transfers with any ERC-20 token or Ether.

**This is ideal for:**
- Global payment settlement
- Application specific tokens
- Virtual gaming tokens and rewards
- Any situations where users are transferring ERC20's

Please see our interactive [üïπÔ∏è Fuel Plays Pok√©mon demo](https://fuelplayspokemon.com) for a live example of transfers in action.

Non-Custodial Exchange
---

Fuel's unique **multi-signature transactions and hash-time-lock contracts** are a perfect foundation for non-custodial exchanges.

**We support two kinds of exchange:**
- Multi-signature Swaps
- HTLC Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps

Mass-Token Dispersal
---

Fuel supports *multi-input, multi-output transactions*, making it perfect for pre-signed mass token dispersal scenarios where a *single account must disperse many-to-millions of tokens* to unique accounts cost-efficiently.

This is possible on Fuel due to a **merklizied dispersal pattern and Fuel's unique pre-signed transaction format**.

Also note, tokens are only dispersed when the user claims them post dispersal event.

For further reading on how we accomplish this for near-zero cost, please see [Token Minting](../4.%20Tools%20and%20Applications/1.%20Token%20Minting.md)

Fast Withdrawals
---

Fuel allows for fast (~10 minute) withdrawals using our unique HTLC output. Liquidity providers on the intended exit chain (e.g. Ethereum or Bitcoin) can allow users on Fuel to withdraw with minimal effort and at low-cost.

For further reading, please see [Fast Withdrawals](../4.%20Tools%20and%20Applications/0.%20Fast%20Withdrawals.md).

Subscriptions
---

Fuel's pre-signed transaction format is ideal for creating regular financial subscriptions, where a user can *sign up* to a subscription, pre-signing a set of transactions, and then allowing any service or system to collect payment on a regular basis non-interactively.

This is allows for cheap, care free, subscriptions for magazines, blogs, forums and more.

For further reading, please see [Subscriptions](../4.%20Tools%20and%20Applications/2.%20Subscriptions.md)

Burning
---

Fuel has a return data output, which can be used to store arbitrary transaction data in the Fuel ORU such as: burn flags, tweets, hashes or specific application data.

The burning of a token by sending it to the null or a voided address can be contextualized around a specific event using the return data output, all within in the same transaction.
