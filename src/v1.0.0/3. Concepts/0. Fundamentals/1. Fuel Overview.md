Fuel Overview
===

This section of the docs goes over the fundamental technical details of the Fuel rollup chain: what it is, how it works, and why it is scalable and secure.

Background
---

Fuel is an _optimistic rollup_, a special sidechain architecture that is both trust-minimized and permissionless. Unlike a [traditional sidechain](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf), where the safety of user funds is dependent on the honest majority of some set of validators that is disjoint from the main chain miners, optimistic rollups borrow security directly from the main chain (Ethereum).

The simplified version of [optimistic rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-merged-consensus/5617) is as follows. Anyone may construct a rollup block off-chain and [submit it to Ethereum as _calldata_]((https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html)) (i.e. simple binary data attached to a transaction). Each block submitted in this manner must build upon the previous rollup block (a contract keep track of block header hashes for the rollup chain) and include a parametrizable bond. If a block is invalid, a [compact fraud proof](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044) can be submitted and processed on-chain by anyone, which will revert the rollup chain to the previous block, burn a portion of the bond, and reward the fraud prover with the rest. After a parametrizable timeout, rollup blocks are _finalized_, and are assumed to be valid (i.e. can no longer be proven fraudulent) and their bond unlocked. Withdrawals are initiated by burning coins on the rollup, then completing the withdrawal after that rollup block has finalized.
