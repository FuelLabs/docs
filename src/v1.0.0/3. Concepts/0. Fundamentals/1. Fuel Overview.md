Fuel Overview
===

This section of the docs goes over the fundamental technical details of the Fuel rollup chain: what it is, how it works, and why it is scalable and secure.

Background
---

Fuel is an _optimistic rollup_, a special sidechain architecture that is both trust-minimized and permissionless. Unlike a [traditional sidechain](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf), where the safety of user funds is dependent on the honest majority of some set of validators that is disjoint from the main chain miners, optimistic rollups borrow security directly from the main chain (Ethereum).

The simplified version of [optimistic rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-merged-consensus/5617) is as follows. Anyone may construct a rollup block off-chain and [submit it to Ethereum as _calldata_]((https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html)) (i.e. simple binary data attached to a transaction). Each block submitted in this manner must build upon the previous rollup block (a contract keep track of block header hashes for the rollup chain) and include a parametrizable bond. If a block is invalid, a [compact fraud proof](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044) can be submitted and processed on-chain by anyone, which will revert the rollup chain to the previous block, burn a portion of the bond, and reward the fraud prover with the rest. After a parametrizable timeout, rollup blocks are _finalized_, and are assumed to be valid (i.e. can no longer be proven fraudulent) and their bond unlocked. Withdrawals are initiated by burning coins on the rollup, then completing the withdrawal after that rollup block has finalized.

Architecture: A High-Level View
---

Fuel is unique among Ethereum rollups in that it uses a [UTXO](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc#transaction-outputs-and-inputs)-based transaction system. This allows for parallel transaction validation, and in the future stateless predicate validation for spending conditions, greatly increasing scalability compared to contemporary accounts-based blockchains and rollups.

Each transaction can spend up to eight inputs and produce up to eight outputs. This allows atomic multi-user transactions, e.g. for an on-chain atomic exchange, which also means that non-custodial exchanges can be built on top of Fuel. The deterministic and stateless nature of computing state element (UTXO) IDs produced and consumed by transactions enables long chains and [even trees of pre-signed transactions](../../4.%20Tools%20and%20Applications/1.%20Token%20Minting.md) to be constructed.

Fuel supports a number of spending conditions that allow for powerful implicit expressivity:
- [HTLC outputs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts), which have both a hashlock and a timelock. These enable cross-chain atomic swaps (including between Fuel and Ethereum for [instant withdrawals](../4.%20Additional%20Modules/HTLC.md)). They can also be used as a signaling mechanism (e.g. to vote in a DAO), and when combined with a chain of pre-signed transactions, for cancellable subscriptions.
- [Return outputs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN), which are unspendable and can include a long binary blob. These can be used to build social media applications that are executed client-side and use Fuel for timestamping messages cheaply.

The fraud proof scheme used by Fuel is unique in that [it does not require state serialization](https://ethresear.ch/t/compact-fraud-proofs-for-utxo-chains-without-intermediate-state-serialization/5885) (computing the Merkle root of the state) after every transaction, or even after every block. State serialization is one of the biggest bottlenecks for Ethereum and accounts-based rollups today, and remains a Herculean challenge to optimize implementations around. This, along with parallelizable transaction validation, make Fuel the most scalable rollup in the world.
