Transferring
===

Now that we have deposited 1 `DAI`, let's send it to our own wallet address on Fuel.

```js
import fuel from '@fuel-js/wallet';

const wallet = new fuel.Wallet(window.web3.currentProvider);

(async () => {

  await wallet.transfer(daiAddress, wallet.address, utils.parseEther('1.0'));

})();
```
