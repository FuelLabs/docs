Quick Start
===

In this guide, we will demonstrate our magical quick-start provider.

Similar to the gas-station network provider, our smart-provider will wrap your existing web3 provider, and will Fuel power your transactions using normal ERC20 contract interactions.

Simply use the Fuel token ID as contract address, and for depositing and withdrawing use the special provided addresses. That's it!

Install
---

```bash
npm install --save @fuel/provider
```

or

```bash
yarn install @fuel/provider
```

Usage
---

```js
import fuel from '@fuel/provider';

const provider = fuel.provider(window.web3.currentProvider);
```

Deposit Funds
---

```js
// using ethers.js
import fuel from '@fuel/provider';
import ethers from 'ethers';
import erc20 from 'erc20';

const provider = fuel.provider(window.web3.currentProvider);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(erc20.abi, fuel.dai, provider);

(async () => {

  // this will transfer underlying Dai to your Fuel deposit address
  await contract.transfer(fuel.deposit, 500000);

})();
```

or

```js
// using web3.js
import Contract from 'web3-eth-contract';

Contract.setProvider(fuel.provider(window.web3.currentProvider));
const contract = new Contract(erc20.abi, fuel.dai);
```

Get Balance
---

```js
  // check your balance like any normal ERC20
  await contract.balanceOf(await provider.getAddress());
```


Make a Transfer
---

```js
  // check your balance like any normal ERC20
  await contract.transfer(someAddress, 500000);
```

Withdraw
---

```js
  // check your balance like any normal ERC20
  await contract.transfer(fuel.withdraw, 500000);
```
