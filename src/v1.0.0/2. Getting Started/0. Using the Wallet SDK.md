Using the Wallet SDK
===

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40fuel-js%2Fwallet.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40fuel-js%2Fwallet)

The wallet is how users and developers can interact with Fuel.

Install
---

The Fuel module is currently available as a UMD through CDN or NPM.

**node.js**

```bash
npm install --save @fuel-js/wallet
```

**browser (UMD)**

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@fuel-js/wallet@latest/umd/fuel.umd.min.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>
```

**browser (ESM)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import fuel from "https://unpkg.com/@fuel-js/wallet@latest/umd/fuel.umd.min.js";
</script>
```

Creating a Wallet
---
The Fuel wallet can be used with or without a standard `web3` or `ethers` provider. The provider will be used for account signing or any Ethereum related actions, such as deposits and withdrawals.

If an override `privateKey` is not specified, the first `account` given by the provider will be used.

If an Ethereum `network` is not specified (e.g. `rinkeby`), it will be requested from the provider.

```js
import fuel from '@fueljs/wallet';

// no provider, privateKey is generated
const wallet = fuel.wallet(null);

// web3 provider, first account used, network gathered from provider
const wallet = fuel.wallet(window.web3.currentProvider);

// provider with override privateKey and network specified
const wallet = fuel.wallet(window.web3.currentProvider, {
  privateKey: fuel.utils.hexlify(fuel.utils.randomBytes(32)),
  network: 'rinkeby',
});
```

Fauceting
---

All Fuel test networks have a token Faucet that will disperse fake tokens to requesting accounts (within several seconds to minutes).

The faucet will dispense `1000` `faucetTokens`.

The faucet test token identifier will always be available in `fuel.contants.faucetToken`.

```js
import fuel from '@fueljs/wallet';

// new wallet
const wallet = fuel.wallet(null, {
  network: 'rinkeby',
});

// faucet fake tokens
await wallet.faucet();

// check your balance
console.log('my balance: ', await wallet.balance(fuel.constants.faucetToken));
```


Depositing
---

You can deposit ERC20 tokens or Ether into Fuel by using the `deposit` method. Simply specify the `token`, and `amount` to deposit.

Because Fuel uses Ethereum key pairs, this process can be done directly with your provided MetaMask account, for example.

The deposit method will make two Ethereum transactions, entering your funds into Fuel, making them accessible for Fuel activites (e.g. `transfers` and `swaps`).

```js
import fuel from '@fuel-js/wallet';

const wallet = new fuel.Wallet(window.web3.currentProvider);

(async () => {

  // rinkeby dai address
  const daiAddress = '0xc3dbf84Abb494ce5199D5d4D815b10EC29529ff8';

  // deposit funds
  await wallet.deposit(daiAddress, fuel.utils.parseEther('1.0'));

})();
```

Transferring
---

Now that you have funds in Fuel, either by `deposit` or `faucet` you can begin to transfer them around.

Let's try transferring `1` Fuel token to our own wallet `address` and check the submission for its `transactionId`.

```js
import fuel from '@fuel-js/wallet';

const wallet = new fuel.Wallet(window.web3.currentProvider);

(async () => {

  await wallet.faucet();

  // transfer one faucet token to our own wallet
  const { transactionId } = await wallet.transfer(
    fuel.constants.faucetToken,
    wallet.address,
    fuel.utils.parseEther('1.0'));

  console.log('view my transaction: https://rinkeby.fuel.sh/tx/' + transactionId);

})();
```

Withdrawing
---

Currently, the Fuel wallet only supports long withdrawal, which means you will send an initial withdraw transaction first, than release it anytime after the finality period of 1 week.

In order to release the tokens on Ethereum, you must have some Ether for the transaction.

In the future, the wallet will support fast withdrawal via HTLC, where total withdraw time can be reduced safely to as little as 5-10 minutes.

```js
import fuel from '@fuel-js/wallet';

const wallet = new fuel.Wallet(window.web3.currentProvider);

(async () => {

  await wallet.faucet();

  // withdraw one faucet token
  await wallet.withdraw(fuel.constants.faucetToken, utils.parseEther('1.0'));

  // wait one week...

  // release any withdrawals onto Ethereum
  await wallet.release();
})();
```
