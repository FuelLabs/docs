|     Exchange settlement on Fuel.      |

Non-custodial exchanges can be built by anyone on top of Fuel today. The order book is kept, and matching is done, off-chain, with settlement of each order happening on Fuel as a multi-user transaction.

In this example, Alice and Bob each consume one of their UTXOs in a transaction, which swaps the owner of each asset to produce two new UTXOs. (Fees and change are an implementation detail.) Note that since users sign over _an entire transaction_, there is no possibility of theft. Alice and Bob can each sign the transaction individually, and any time before the transaction is confirmed, can spend their UTXO in a different transaction to cancel the order.
