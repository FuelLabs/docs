Mass Token Minting
===

Minting and distributing tokens to a large number of users is a fairly common pattern, especially for community-driven applications and rewards or reputation points. Generally, tokens of this form are distributed in a permissioned manner by a central party, as un-gameable global reputation is non-trivial. However, once the tokens have been distributed they cannot be reclaimed by the issuer.

While it is certainly possible to do this relatively inexpensively by using one-to-many transactions (as Fuel supports [up to eight inputs and eight outputs](../3.%20Concepts/0.%20Fundamentals/4.%20Transaction%20Architecture.md) per transactions), we can do even better!

First, let us consider how one would make distributing such tokens cheaper on Ethereum today.  There are two easy, concrete methods:
1. The issuer pre-signs an authorization to mint a certain number of tokens for a particular user. She then sends the user the pre-signed authorization, which the user can redeem to the token contract for tokens. In this case, the issuer does not pay anything to distribute the token, as gas costs are covered by the user.
1. The issuer posts a _commitment_ (e.g. a Merkle root) of new coin balances to the token contract, which is an `O(1)`-cost operation. Users can then withdraw their tokens with a Merkle inclusion proof. In this case, the issuer pays a constant cost to distribute tokens, regardless of the number of tokens or users.

These schemes do not work on Fuel [`v1`](../5.%20Future%20Roadmap/1.%20Planned%20Features.md), as generic smart contracts are not supported. But what if we combined the two approaches?
